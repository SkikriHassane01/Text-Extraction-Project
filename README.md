## Text Extraction Project
Text detection and extraction are important tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. They are commonly used in many applications such as optical character recognition (OCR), document analysis, and text recognition in images and videos.


## The importance of OpenCV and OCR in this project?
OpenCV is a tool that helps us with computer vision and machine learning tasks. OCR is a technology that can recognize text from images. To recognize text from an image, we need to identify the geometric shapes that represent the text in the image, such as rectangles, circles, or ellipses. OpenCV provides functions that can detect these shapes in an image.

Once we have identified the structural elements, OCR algorithms are used to recognize the text within them. OCR algorithms segment the image into smaller regions based on the structural elements detected, and then they process these segments to recognize the characters present in them.

Combining OpenCV and OCR, we can create powerful text recognition systems that accurately recognize text from images. We can use these systems in various applications such as document scanning, automatic number plate recognition, and digital image processing.

OpenCV and OCR can work together to find the boundaries of an object in an image, which is known as a contour. This is an essential step in many computer vision applications, including object detection and recognition.

To find the contour, we first pre-process the image to enhance the object’s edges using techniques like thresholding or edge detection. Then, we apply dilation, a morphological operation, to make the object’s boundaries more distinct. Using the findContours function in OpenCV, we can detect the object’s contours, which are represented as a sequence of points. Finally, OCR can be used to recognize and extract text from the image by analyzing the shapes and patterns of the text and matching them to a known character database.
